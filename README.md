Using example data, this React application displays movies with their descriptions (as dummy text). I had help from libraries/modules.

## Local Setup
Clone this repository: 
### `git clone https://github.com/shirleyc40/Coding-Challenge`

Navigate to the directory and run: 
### `npm install`
To run the app in development mode on your local server:
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Additional Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I had some struggles getting the sliding transition. I had the switching and data rendering implemented, but I didn't know how to do a slide transition. So I decided to get help from react-bootstrap and customize it. I kept my original code for reference. Due to my unfamiliarity using Vimeo API without a simple API, I decided not to use the API. However, I have intentions of learning more about APIs and bettering this application.
